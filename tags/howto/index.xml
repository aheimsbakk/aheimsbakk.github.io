      <description>&lt;p&gt;Why should you encrypt your disc in the first place? It&amp;rsquo;s for your own privacy. It&amp;rsquo;s to ensure that personal data doesn&amp;rsquo;t go astray.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>snapper - filesystem snapshot management</title>
      <link>https://blog.heimsbakk.net/posts/20200825-snapper/</link>

      <guid>https://blog.heimsbakk.net/posts/20200825-snapper/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Excerpt from &lt;code&gt;man&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Snapper is a command-line program for filesystem snapshot management. It can create, delete and compare snapshots and undo changes done between snapshots.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Snapper never modifies the content of snapshots. Thus snapper creates read-only snapshots if supported by the kernel. Supported filesystems are btrfs as well as snapshots of LVM logical volumes with thin-provisioning.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Your private SSH key is the key for the kingdom. This means always having a password on the key. With YubiKey, you can keep your secret key outside your machine too.
Excerpt from Wikipedia: The YubiKey allows users to sign, encrypt and decrypt messages without exposing the private keys to the outside world.</description>

      <title>Compressed RAM based block devices</title>

      <guid>https://blog.heimsbakk.net/posts/20150111-zram/</guid>
      <description>From zram documentation: The zram module creates RAM based block devices named /dev/zram(= 0, 1, &amp;hellip;). Pages written to these disks are compressed and stored in memory itself. These disks allow very fast I/O and compression provides good amounts of memory savings. Some of the usecases include /tmp storage, use as swap disks, various caches under /var and maybe many more :)</description>

      <title>Record a PulseAudio sound stream</title>

      <description>Ever wondered on how to record the audio from one application? Either the browser or a streaming application that don&amp;rsquo;t have the option to save audio to a file.
The PulseAudio sound server in your desktop makes this quite easy.
I&amp;rsquo;ve created a small script that captures the current playing sound stream and redirects it to FLAC audio file.</description>

      <description>If you want to use Vagrant with OpenStack, you need to prepare Vagrant with installing the vagrant-openstack-plugin. I had some problems installing it directly through vagrant plugin install. I had to clone it from Github and install it manually.
One time configuration ðŸ”—Install OpenStack plugin in Vagrant ðŸ”—cd /tmp git clone https://github.</description>

      <description>Google now supports Google Earth in Google Maps. As far as I know it works in Chrome and Chromium. If Google Earth isn&amp;rsquo;t available where the satellite view options is, your graphic card is in the browsers blacklist.

      <description>This is my notes for how to update my Pelican blog automaticlly when I write new posts. See Creating a blog based on Pelican for getting started with Pelican blog engine.
A way to be able to blog from anywhere is to use Dropbox as repository for the your blog. Then let Pelican auto regenerate the blog on changes in the Dropbox folder.</description>

      <title>Configuring OpenVPN server on RTN66U</title>
      <link>https://blog.heimsbakk.net/posts/20140501-easyrsa/</link>

      <description>The router firmware Tomato, see previous post RT-N66u with Tomato by Shibby firmware, can act as an OpenVPN server.
Using open Wi-Fi access points can be very useful and necessary, but it is inherently insecure. Using the router as an OpenVPN server can increase your privacy and security when you are on the go.</description>

      <title>RT-N66u with Tomato by Shibby firmware</title>

      <guid>https://blog.heimsbakk.net/posts/20140417-tomato/</guid>
      <description>This is a part of my personal notes. Use this information at your own risk. If you are uncertain or don&amp;rsquo;t know what you are doing. Do not proceed.
Asus RT-N66U is a Linux based wireless router. The stock firmware can be a bit limiting for the more advanced user. If you want better QoS, OpenVPN or just more control over the network I recommend installing Tomato by Shibby firmware.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Options set in &lt;code&gt;.vimrc&lt;/code&gt; applies to all vim files. You can use modelines to set specific vim options for one file. Modeline option must be set in &lt;code&gt;.vimrc&lt;/code&gt; to take advantage of this option.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Pelican is a static website generator written in Python. It&amp;rsquo;s perfect for maintaining a tiny blog without having to mess around with databases. Static pages can be served from any Web server. Even your wireless router if you run custom firmware as Tomato by Shibby or dd-wrt.
Running Ubuntu Trusty I chose to use Pelican package in repository.</description>
