                            <h2>Vagrant is a great way to script development environments for system administrators. It works with full virtualization and is closer to the real hardware than container systems.
There is a bug in the latest version of Ubuntu (Vagrant Box) that makes it hang during boot. It even hangs the VirtualBox and makes the GUI misbehave. The reason is a missing redirect of the console serial device. Console output fills up a buffer and then just hangs.</h2>

restic is a deduplication backup sofware, designed for ease of use and security. Rclone is a versatile program for syncing data between a huge variety of protocols and cloud providers. What is especially nifty is that restic can use rclone as a backend, and by that extend restic destination into most cloud providers.</h2>
