From zram_ documentation: *The zram module creates RAM based block devices named /dev/zram<id> (<id> = 0, 1, ...). Pages written to these disks are compressed and stored in memory itself. These disks allow very fast I/O and compression provides good amounts of memory savings. Some of the usecases include /tmp storage, use as swap disks, various caches under /var and maybe many more :)*

====================================
Example of compressed swap in memory
====================================

Write this commands in :code:`/etc/rc.local` to create a 2G compressed swap partition in memory.

.. code-block:: bash
    :linenos: table

    # Load the module and create one zram device, /dev/zram0
    modprobe zram num_devices=1

    # Maximum of compressed streams (keep same as CPUs)
    echo 4 > /sys/devices/virtual/block/zram0/max_comp_streams

    # Size of zram0 device in k/m/g
    echo 2g > /sys/devices/virtual/block/zram0/disksize

    # Comression compression algorithm to use
    echo lzo > /sys/devices/virtual/block/zram0/comp_algorithm

    # Create the swap file system
    mkswap /dev/zram0

    # Enable the swap partition with high priority
    swapon /dev/zram0 -p 10
