[Pelican](http://getpelican.com) is a static website generator written in Python. It's perfect for maintaining a tiny blog without having to mess around with databases. Static pages can be served from any Web server. Even your wireless router if you run custom firmware as [Tomato by Shibby](http://tomato.groov.pl) or [dd-wrt](http://www.dd-wrt.com).

Running Ubuntu Trusty I chose to use Pelican package in repository. A very quick recipe for creating a blog with the default theme.

1. Install Pelican and package for [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) language. With Markdown you write the content in text and Pelican translates it to HTML.

        apt-get install python-pelican python-markdown

2. Make a directory where you want to maintain your blog.

        mkdir myblock; cd myblock

3. Run the Pelican quick start script and answer all the questions. Add at least one method of uploading your blog to a web server.

        pelican-quickstart

4. Start by creating your first page in `content` directory. Each page should have a heading with some metadata.

5. Start the local HTTP server and check how your blog is coming along.

        make serve

6. Point your browser to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

7. Upload your blog to your web server. I prefer the ssh upload option.

        make ssh_upload

A more lengthy and better [getting started guide](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.3.0/getting_started.html) on getpelican.com. I did find adam-p's [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) on [github] quite useful. And not to forget all the themes you can [download](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes) from [github].
