Excerpt from Remy van Elsts tutorial: *[OCSP] stapling is an enhancement to the standard [OCSP] protocol that delivers [OCSP] responses from the server with the certificate, eliminating the need for relying parties (web users) to check [OCSP] responses with the issuing [CA]. This has the effect of reducing bandwidth, improving perceived site performance, and increasing security for everyone involved in establishing the secure session. This tutorial shows you how to set it up with [Apache].*

## Summary

Create [OCSP] stapling configuration for [Apache].

    cat <<EOF > /etc/apache2/conf-available/sslstapeling.conf
    SSLUseStapling on
    SSLStaplingCache "shmcb:logs/stapling-cache(150000)"
    SSLStaplingResponseMaxAge 900
    EOF

Enable configuration, test it and do a restart of [Apache] if all is OK.

    a2enconf sslstapeling
    apache2ctl configtest
    apache2ctl restart

Check [OCSP] with [OpenSSL].

    openssl s_client -connect «yoursite»:443 -tls1 -tlsextdebug -status
