How to convert a root file system on a [Raspberry Pi 4 b](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) running [Ubuntu 20.04](https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi) 64 bit to [Btrfs](https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/) in a few simple steps.

## Why

First, why should I care about doing this.

* Btrfs is SSD-aware, even on a SD card. The copy on write file system will ensure that your writes will be spread out and decrease wear leveling.
* You can enable a CPU friendly compression, [zstd](https://github.com/facebook/zstd), that decreases the amount of data written to your SD card.

## How

1. Flash Ubuntu on the SD card as usual.
0. Boot once as usual and let the file system expand to the space of the SD card.
0. Log into the Raspberry Pi.
0. Tell boot to read from a Btrfs file system on next boot
    ```bash
    sudo sed -i 's/ext4/btrfs/' /boot/firmware/cmdline.txt
    ```
0. Update `/etc/fstab` with new file system, and ensure minimum writes to SD card.
    ```bash
    sudo sed -E -i 's|(.*)ext4.*|\1btrfs compress=zstd:1,noatime,nodiratime 0 0|' /etc/fstab
    ```
0. Shutdown your system.
    ```bash
    sudo halt
    ```
0. Take out your SD card and put it into your **Linux** workstation or laptop. Convert the file system on the SD card. If the SD cards `ext4` partition are `/dev/sda2` then the command will be as follows. Let the command finish.
    ```bash
    sudo btrfs-convert -p /dev/sda2
    ```
0. Put the SD card back in the Raspberry Pi and boot. Voila! You have a Btrfs root file system.
0. Log into the Raspberry Pi for some cleanup.
0. Remove the old `ext2` backup.
    ```bash
    sudo btrfs sub del /ext2_saved
    ```
0. Defrag and compress already existing OS.
    ```bash
    sudo btrfs fi def -czstd -r -v /
    ```

Congratulations! Now you have a Btrfs root file system with compression. Writes will take less space, and wear leveling is down. Note that you also have saved space by running a `df -h /`. Enjoy a SD card that will last longer than you are used to.
