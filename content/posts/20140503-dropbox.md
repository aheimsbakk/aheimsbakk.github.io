This is my notes for how to update my [Pelican] blog automaticlly when I write new posts. See [Creating a blog based on Pelican](2014-04-12-pelican) for getting started with [Pelican] blog engine.

A way to be able to blog from anywhere is to use [Dropbox] as repository for the your blog. Then let [Pelican] auto regenerate the blog on changes in the [Dropbox] folder.

A prerequest for this recipe is that `/var/www` is not directly exposed to the web.

## Preparing Dropbox

First create a new [Dropbox] account and create a `Pelican` folder. Share this folder with your main [Dropbox] account. Now copy the sources for your [Pelican] blog into the the shared folder.

On your web server, install [Dropbox] under the `www-data` user.

```bash
cd ~ && wget -O - "https://www.dropbox.com/download?plat=lnx.x86_64" | tar xzf -
```

Then link up the new [Dropbox] account to the web server by accessing the link you get from starting the [Dropbox] daemon.

```bash
~/.dropbox-dist/dropboxd
```

Edit crontab for `www-data`, `crontab -e`, to start [Dropbox] daemon if it's not running. useful when the server reboots.

```cron
*/5 * * * * pgrep -F ~/.dropbox/dropbox.pid >/dev/null || (~/.dropbox-dist/dropboxd &)
```

Now [Dropbox] should be in sync and have your latest source for the blog.

## Autogenerate blog on change

We need to install [Pelican] blog engine and [incron] to trigger auto generation of the blog on changes in the `~/Dropbox/Pelican/content` folder.

```bash
sudo apt-get install python-pelican python-markdown incron
```

Edit `DROPBOX_DIR` the the [Pelican] `Makefile` to point to the [VirtualHost] which stores the blog.

Then allow the `www-data` user to run incron.

```bash
echo www-data | sudo tee -a /etc/incron.allow
```
And as a final step make the incrontab entry for `www-data` with `Ã¬ncrontab -e`

```
/var/www/Dropbox/Pelican/content IN_ATTRIB,IN_CREATE,IN_DELETE,IN_NO_LOOP make --directory /var/www/Dropbox/Pelican dropbox_upload
```

Now [Pelican] will recreate the blog on each change in `~/Dropbox/Pelican/content`. Happy blogging!
