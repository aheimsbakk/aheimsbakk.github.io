From Wikipedia: *The [YubiKey][] is a hardware authentication device manufactured by [Yubico][] to protect access to computers, networks, and online services that supports one-time passwords (OTP), public-key cryptography, and authentication, and the Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) and FIDO2 protocols developed by the FIDO Alliance.*

To get up and running on a new machine with minimal fuss.


ssh-keygen -t ed25519-sk -O resident -O application="ssh:home"
