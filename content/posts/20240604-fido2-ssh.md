From Wikipedia: *The [YubiKey][] is a hardware authentication device manufactured by [Yubico][] to protect access to computers, networks, and online services that supports one-time passwords (OTP), public-key cryptography, and authentication, and the Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) and FIDO2 protocols developed by the [FIDO Alliance][].*

We're going to create a [ed25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA) SSH key that lives on the YubiKey. This works a bit different than GPG keys. Both private and public key resides on the YubiKey.

## Caveats

Lets start with the issues.

* You will only have one copy of your key that can't be used without the YubiKey.
* Ref. [Arch Wiki/SSH keys](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/SSH_keys) there is a [bug](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3572), you can't use pin verification for every use.
  * Presence is mandatory - push button on use.
* Ensure that you have a different key to access your computers, Yubikeys can be lost!

## Configuration

* Create a new key. Application `ssh:` is mandatory, `domain` may be useful and `user` is optional.
  ```bash
  ssh-keygen -t ed25519-sk -O resident -O application="ssh:domain -O user="$(whoami)"
  ```
* Sett a password for the private key.
* Remove private and public key from you machine.
  ```bash
  rm $HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk*
  ```

## Day to day usage

Read the key from the YubiKey and SSH as normal. You need to press the key every time it starts blinking to verify that you are present.

* Add your YubiKey SSH key(s) to the `ssh-agent`.
  ```bash
  ssh-add -K
  ```

## Fetch a copy of the key(s)

You still need the YubiKey to use SSH. But now your `ssh-agent` can know about the keys all the time.

* Go to you `.ssh` directory.
  ```bash
  cd $HOME/.ssh
  ```
* Download your keys.
  ```bash
  ssh-keygen -K
  ```
* Set a password on the private key.
