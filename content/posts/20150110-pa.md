Ever wondered on how to record the audio from one application? Either the browser or a streaming application that don't have the option to save audio to a file.

The [PulseAudio] sound server in your desktop makes this quite easy.

I've created a small script that captures the current playing sound stream and redirects it to [FLAC] audio file. After the capture is started, you can start playing sound from other programs. It won't interfere with the current capture.

## Capture audio

### Pre requests

You have to install a couple of programs, if you don't have them from before, to make the bash script work.

```bash
apt-get install pulseaudio-utils flac coreutils
```

### The script

This is my `record-app.sh` script.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

BN=$(basename $0)
SI=$(pacmd list-sink-inputs | grep -m 1 index | egrep -o "[[:digit:]]+")

if [[ "$1" == "" ]]; then
  echo "usage: $BN filename"
  exit 1
fi

if [[ "$SI" == "" ]]; then
  echo "error: no input sinks found"
  exit 2
fi

N="$1"

echo $BN recording:
echo · Found sink index «$SI»
echo · Loading module-null-sink
MI=$(pactl load-module module-null-sink sink_name=rec)
trap "{ echo · Trying to delete null sink «rec»; pactl unload-module $MI; }" EXIT
echo · Moving sink «$SI» to null sink «rec»
pactl move-sink-input $SI rec
echo · Saving sound data to «$N.flac»
parec -d rec.monitor | flac --endian=little --sign=signed --channels=2 --bps=16n --sample-rate=44100 -o "$1.flac" - 2>/dev/null
```

### Usage

```bash
usage: record-app.sh filename
```

#### Example 1

```bash
./record-app.sh firefox-sound
```

Will start to record the current playing audio in Firefox. The audio is saved int the file `firefox-sound.flac`.

#### Example 2

```bash
timeout 1h ./record-app.sh firefox-sound
```

Will record the current playing audio in Firefox for one hour, and then automatically quit. Audio saved to `firefox-sound.flac` in this example too.

## Caveats

* If the file you record to exists, the program automatically quits
* To ensure capture of the sound, only play sound from one program
* Using the timeout command will yield in a non fatal error on exit
* While capturing, no sound will be played through the speakers

    A workaround for this is to start playing the captured file. It won't interfere with the capture of the sound.
