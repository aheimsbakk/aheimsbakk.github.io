From Wikipedia: *The [YubiKey][] is a hardware authentication device manufactured by [Yubico][] to protect access to computers, networks, and online services that supports one-time passwords (OTP), public-key cryptography, and authentication, and the Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) and FIDO2 protocols developed by the FIDO Alliance.*

To get up and running on a new machine with minimal fuss.


## `.bashrc`

When you are not logged in via SSH, start the `gpg-agent`. Copy and paste into your terminal to append the configuration to your current `.bashrc`.

```bash
cat <<EOF >> ~/.bashrc
if [[ -z "\$SSH_CONNECTION" ]]
then
  export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=\$(gpgconf --list-dirs agent-ssh-socket)
  gpgconf --launch gpg-agent
fi
EOF
```

## `.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf`

Configure the `gpg-agent` to enable SSH support. Copy and paste into your terminal to overwrites the file `.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf` with this configuration.

```bash
cat <<EOF > ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
enable-ssh-support
default-cache-ttl 600
max-cache-ttl 7200
EOF
```
