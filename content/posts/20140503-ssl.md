This will show how to get A+ on [SSL Server Test](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest) from [Qualys SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com).

<!--more-->

Enable [SSL] and [headers] module in [Apache2].

    a2enmod ssl
    a2enmod headers

Edit Apache configuration.

    SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/crt/«yourcert».pem
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/crt/«yourkey».pem
    SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/ssl/crt/«intermediatechain».pem

    Header always set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"
    SSLEngine on
    SSLProtocol all -SSLv2 -SSLv3
    SSLHonorCipherOrder On
    SSLCipherSuite EECDH:EDH:AES:!aNULL:!eNULL:!LOW:!RC4:!3DES:!DES:!MD5:!EXP:!PSK:!SRP:!DSS

The **!** preceding the cipher means that Apache will not use that cipher.

## View ciphers

List the ciphers openssl supports with the current configuration.

    openssl ciphers -v -ssl3 -tls1 'EECDH:EDH:AES:!aNULL:!eNULL:!LOW:!RC4:!3DES:!DES:!MD5:!EXP:!PSK:!SRP:!DSS'

## Explanation

With this configuration Apache will prefer [Perfect forward secrecy]. If [Perfect forward secrecy] can't be negotiated it will default to [AES] cipher. This configuration will work on all newer browser. Exceptions are older [IE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_explorer), older Java and a few bots.

Where there are no links to the information source it's taken from the [documentation](https://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html) on [openssl.org](https://www.openssl.org).

#### Header always set Strict-Transport-Security

Force browser to use [HTTPS] even if the user enters [HTTP]. The browser should remember this setting for a really long time, example a year.

#### SSLHonorCipherOrder On

Use the servers preferred encryption not the browsers which may be a weaker cipher.

#### EECDH

Ephemeral elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman, see [ECDH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECDH).

#### EDH

Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman, see [Diffie–Hellman key exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie-Helmann).

#### AES

[Advanced Encryption Standard][AES].

#### !aNULL

The cipher suites offering no authentication. This is currently the anonymous DH algorithms. These cipher suites are vulnerable to a ``man in the middle'' attack and so their use is normally discouraged.

#### !eNULL

The «NULL» ciphers that is those offering no encryption.

#### !LOW

«Low» encryption cipher suites, currently those using 64 or 56 bit encryption algorithms but excluding export cipher suites.

#### !RC4

[RC4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rc4) stream cipher. After attacks on RC4 it is said to be vulnerable. See [New RC4 Attack](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/03/new_rc4_attack.html) for more information.

#### !3DES

[Triple DES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3des).

#### !DES

[Data Encryption Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard).

#### !MD5

[MD5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Md5) message-digest algorithm.

#### !EXP

Export encryption algorithms. Including 40 and 56 bits algorithms.

#### !PSK

Cipher suites using pre-shared keys (PSK).

#### !SRP

[Secure Remote Password protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Remote_Password_protocol).

#### !DSS

Cipher suites using DSS authentication, i.e. the certificates carry DSS keys.
