      <title>Distributed syncing with Syncthing</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to ditch Dropbox for a long time. But the need for synchronizing folders between my computers have held me back. Syncthing solves this for me. It&amp;rsquo;s decentralized syncrhonization between all my units, including my phone, without the need to go through a 3rd party server.
Excerpt from Syncthings homepage: Syncthing replaces proprietary sync and cloud services with something open, trustworthy and decentralized.</description>

      <title>Compressed RAM based block devices</title>
      <link>https://blog.heimsbakk.net/posts/20150111-zram/</link>

      <description>From zram documentation: The zram module creates RAM based block devices named /dev/zram(= 0, 1, &amp;hellip;). Pages written to these disks are compressed and stored in memory itself. These disks allow very fast I/O and compression provides good amounts of memory savings. Some of the usecases include /tmp storage, use as swap disks, various caches under /var and maybe many more :)</description>

      <title>Vagrant, development environments made easy</title>
      <link>https://blog.heimsbakk.net/posts/20140525-vagrant/</link>

      <description>Prototyping and testing configurations and system installations is time consuming on traditional hardware. That is why I started using Vagrant for nearly all development, prototyping and testing. It&amp;rsquo;s free and really easy to use. If you install VirtualBox sudo apt-get install virtualbox first, you&amp;rsquo;ll be up and running in no time.</description>

      <description>oSteve Gibson have a nice round-up where he explains how certificate revocation does work and why Chrome and Chromiums certificate revocation scheme doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. I recommend to read both Steve Gibson&amp;lsquo;s article on An Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Chrome&amp;rsquo;s CRLSets and Adam Langley&amp;rsquo;s in my opinion a bit missplaced answer Revocation still doesn&amp;rsquo;t work.</description>

      <title>OCSP Stapling on Apache</title>
      <link>https://blog.heimsbakk.net/posts/20140504-ocsp/</link>

      <description>Excerpt from Remy van Elsts tutorial: OCSP stapling is an enhancement to the standard OCSP protocol that delivers OCSP responses from the server with the certificate, eliminating the need for relying parties (web users) to check OCSP responses with the issuing CA. This has the effect of reducing bandwidth, improving perceived site performance, and increasing security for everyone involved in establishing the secure session.</description>

      <title>Better entropy with haveged</title>

      <description>Entropy is important for generating good encryption keys. Do you have a busy server relying on crypto, generating keys, you need lot of good entropy. Or if you have a disk less system you don&amp;rsquo;t get as much entropy from the kernel that you may wish. One way to get a lot of good entropy is to use haveged.</description>
